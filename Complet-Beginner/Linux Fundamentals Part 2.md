     1. How would you create the file named "newnote"?
        - `touch newnote`
     2. On the deployable machine, what is the file type of "unknown1" in "tryhackme's" home directory?
        - `ASCII text`
     3. How would we move the file "myfile" to the directory "myfolder"?
        - `mv myfile myfolder`
     4. What are the contents of this file?
        - `THM{FILESYSTEM}`
     5. Continue to apply your knowledge and practice the commands from this task.
        - `No anser needed`
     ## Task 5 Permissions 101 
     We Will Cover in this Task about Permissions files [Read,Write and Execute] , The Difference Between Users & Groups And Switchind Betwee users `su username`
     1. On the deployable machine, who is the owner of "important"?
        - `user2`
     2.  What would the command be to switch to the user "user2"? 
         - `su user2`
     3. Now switch to this user "user2" using the password "user2"
        - `No answer needed`
     4. Output the contents of "important", what is the flag?
        - `THM{SU_USER2}`
     ## Task 6 - Common Directories
     We Will Cover in this Task about Common directories in unix systems [/etc,/var,/root./tmp]
     - /etc (for root directory Store system files that are used by OS {'passwd','shadow'})
     - /var (for Stores Data that is frequently accessed or written by services or applications running on the system like logs.)
     - /root (for The hoem for the root 'System User')
     - /tmp (Like Ram in windows used to store data but temporary,when computer is restarted, the data is cleared)
     1.  Read me! 
         - `No answer needed`
     2. What is the directory path that would we expect logs to be stored in?
         - `/var/log`

        - `/tmp`
     4. Name the home directory of the root user 
        - '/root'
     5. Now apply your learning and navigate through these directories on the deployed Linux machine.
        - 'No answer needed'
     ## Task 7 - Conclusions and Summaries 
     We Finished Now :D For This room You can Terminate room Now.
     1. Proceed to the next task to continue your learning
        - 'No answer needed'
     ## Task 8  - Linux Fundamentals Part 3 
     Just Go To Part 3 
     1. Terminate the machine from task 2!
        - `No answer needed`
     2. Join Linux Fundamentals Part 3!
        - `No answer needed`
